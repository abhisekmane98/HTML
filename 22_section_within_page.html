		<h2 id="Football">Football</h2>
		<p>Association football, more commonly known as simply football or soccer,[a] is a team sport played with a spherical
		   ball between two teams of 11 players. It is played by approximately 250 million players in over 200 countries and
		   dependencies, making it the world's most popular sport. The game is played on a rectangular field called a pitch
		   with a goal at each end. The object of the game is to score more goals than the opposition by moving the ball beyond
		   the goal line into the opposing goal, usually within a time frame of 90 or more minutes. Football is played in accordance
		   with a set of rules known as the Laws of the Game. The ball is 68–70 cm (27–28 in) in circumference and known as the football.
		   The two teams compete to get the ball into the other team's goal (between the posts and under the bar), thereby scoring a goal.
		   Players are not allowed to touch the ball with hands or arms while it is in play, except for the goalkeepers within the penalty area.
		   Players may use any other part of their body to strike or pass the ball, and mainly use their feet. The team that scores more goals at
		   the end of the game is the winner; if both teams have scored an equal number of goals, either a draw is declared or the game goes into
		   extra time or a penalty shootout, depending on the format of the competition. Each team is led by a captain who has only one official
		   responsibility as mandated by the Laws of the Game: to represent their team in the coin toss prior to kick-off or penalty kicks.[4]

		<h2 id="Cricket">Cricket</h2>
		<p>Cricket is a bat-and-ball game played between two teams of eleven players on a field at the centre of which is a 22-yard (20-metre) pitch
		   with a wicket at each end, each comprising two bails balanced on three stumps. The batting side scores runs by striking the ball bowled
		   at the wicket with the bat (and running between the wickets), while the bowling and fielding side tries to prevent this (by preventing the
		   ball from leaving the field, and getting the ball to either wicket) and dismiss each batter (so they are "out"). Means of dismissal include
	  	   being bowled, when the ball hits the stumps and dislodges the bails, and by the fielding side either catching the ball after it is hit by the
		   bat and before it hits the ground, or hitting a wicket with the ball before a batter can cross the crease in front of the wicket. When ten batters
	   	   have been dismissed, the innings ends and the teams swap roles. The game is adjudicated by two umpires, aided by a third umpire and match referee in international matches.
 	  	   Forms of cricket range from Twenty20, with each team batting for a single innings of 20 overs, to Test matches played over five days. Traditionally cricketers play in all-white
		   kit, but in limited overs cricket they wear club or team colours. In addition to the basic kit, some players wear protective gear to prevent injury caused by the ball, which is a hard,
		   solid spheroid made of compressed leather with a slightly raised sewn seam enclosing a cork core layered with tightly wound string.

		<h3 id="Tennis">Tennis</h3>
		<P>Tennis is a racket sport that can be played individually against a single opponent (singles) or between two teams of two players each (doubles). Each player uses a tennis racket that
		   is strung with cord to strike a hollow rubber ball covered with felt over or around a net and into the opponent's court. The object of the game is to manoeuvre the ball in such a way
		   that the opponent is not able to play a valid return. The player who is unable to return the ball will not gain a point, while the opposite player will. Tennis is an Olympic sport and
		   is played at all levels of society and at all ages. The sport can be played by anyone who can hold a racket, including wheelchair users. The modern game of tennis originated in Birmingham,
		   England, in the late 19th century as lawn tennis.[1] It had close connections both to various field (lawn) games such as croquet and bowls as well as to the older racket sport today called
		   real tennis. During most of the 19th century, in fact, the term tennis referred to real tennis, not lawn tennis. The rules of modern tennis have changed little since the 1890s. Two exceptions
		   are that from 1908 to 1961 the server had to keep one foot on the ground at all times, and the adoption of the tiebreak in the 1970s. A recent addition to professional tennis has been the adoption
		   of electronic review technology coupled with a point-challenge system, which allows a player to contest the line call of a point, a system known as Hawk-Eye. Tennis is played by millions of recreational
		   players and is also a popular worldwide spectator sport. The four Grand Slam tournaments (also referred to as the Majors) are especially popular: the Australian Open played on hard courts, the French Open
		   played on red clay courts, Wimbledon played on grass courts, and the US Open also played on hard courts.
