			Benjamin Andrew Stokes OBE (born 4 June 1991) is an English international cricketer. Stokes was part of the England squad that won the 2019 Cricket World Cup, winning Man of the Match in the final. He has captained the England team in both Tests and One Day Internationals when the regular captain has been unavailable. Born in Christchurch, New Zealand, Stokes moved to northern England with his parents at the age of 12,[2] where he learnt the game and began playing club cricket for local teams. A left-handed batsman and right-arm fast-medium swing bowler, Stokes was ranked the top-ranked Test all-rounder in the world in July 2020.[3] As a bowler, Stokes consistently bowls at around the 140kph (87 mph) mark and he can also swing the ball. An attacking middle-order batsman, he holds the record for England's fastest ever Test double-century,[4] the fastest ever Test match 250, and the highest ever score for a Test batsman batting at number six. He also holds the record for the most runs scored by an individual batsman in the morning session of a Test match. Stokes became the highest-paid overseas player in the history of the Indian Premier League in 2017, fetching a record contract of ₹14.5 million ($2.1 million or £1.7 million); he won the Most Valuable Player award during the season. In January 2020, Stokes was awarded the Sir Garfield Sobers Trophy for Best Cricketer of the Year by the International Cricket Council (ICC)[5] and three months later was named the Wisden Leading Cricketer in the World for 2019,[6][7] an award he picked up again the next year.[8] On the 30 July 2021 it was announced that Stokes would take an "indefinite break" from cricket.[9]

			Jack Ma Yun[a] (Chinese: 马云; [mà y̌n]; born 10 September 1964) is a Chinese business magnate, investor and philanthropist. He is the co-founder and former executive chairman of Alibaba Group, a multinational, technology conglomerate. In addition, he co-founded Yunfeng Capital, a private equity firm. Ma is a strong proponent of an open and market-driven economy.In 2017, Ma was ranked second in the annual "World's 50 Greatest Leaders" list by Fortune.[3] He has widely been considered as an informal global ambassador for Chinese business, and is an influential figure for the community of startup businesses.[4] In September 2018, he announced that he would retire from Alibaba and pursue educational work, philanthropy, and environmental causes;[5][6][7][8] the following year, Daniel Zhang succeeded him as executive chairman.[9] As of April 2021, with a net worth of $51.5 billion, Ma is the third-wealthiest person in China (after Zhong Shanshan and Ma Huateng), as well as one of the wealthiest people in the world, ranked 26th by Bloomberg Billionaires Index.[2] In 2019, Forbes named Ma in its list of "Asia's 2019 Heroes of Philanthropy" for his work supporting underprivileged communities in China, Africa, Australia, and the Middle East.Jack Ma was born in Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China. He began studying English at a young age by conversing with English-speakers at Hangzhou International Hotel. For nine years, Ma would ride 27 km (17 miles) on his bicycle to give tourists tours of the area to practice his English. He became pen pals with one of those foreigners, who nicknamed him "Jack" because he found it hard to pronounce his Chinese name.[11] Later in his youth, Ma struggled attending college. Ma failed the entrance exam for the Hangzhou Teachers College twice as his weak point was mathematics.[12] The Chinese entrance exams, held annually, took Ma three years to pass. Ma attended Hangzhou Teacher's Institute (currently known as Hangzhou Normal University) and graduated in 1988 with a Bachelor of Arts in English.[13][14] While at school, Ma was head of the student council.[15] After graduation, he became a lecturer in English and international trade at Hangzhou Dianzi University. He also claims to have applied ten times to Harvard Business School and got rejected each time.[16]According to Ma's autobiographical speech,[17] after graduating from Hangzhou Normal University in 1988, Ma applied for 30 different odd jobs and was rejected by every one. "I went for a job with the police; they said, 'you're no good'", Ma told interviewer Charlie Rose. "I even went to KFC when it came to my city. Twenty-four people went for the job. Twenty-three were accepted. I was the only guy [rejected]...".[18] During this period, China was in its first decade of Deng Xiaoping's Chinese economic reform.In 1994, Ma heard about the Internet and also started his first company,[19] Hangzhou Haibo Translation Agency (杭州海波翻譯社). In early 1995, he went to the US on behalf of the municipal government with colleagues who had helped introduce him to the Internet.[19] Although he found information related to beer from many countries, he was surprised to find none from China. He also tried to search for general information about China and again was surprised to find none. So he and his friend created an "ugly" website related to China.[20] He launched the website at 9:40 AM, and by 12:30 PM he had received emails from some Chinese investors wishing to know about him. This was when Ma realized that the Internet had something great to offer. In April 1995, Ma and He Yibing (a computer teacher) opened the first office for China Pages, and Ma started their second company. On 10 May 1995, they registered the domain chinapages.com in the United States. Within three years, the company had made 5,000,000 Renminbi which at the time was equivalent to US$800,000.Ma began building websites for Chinese companies with the help of friends in the US. He said that "The day we got connected to the Web, I invited friends and TV people over to my house", and on a very slow dial-up connection, "we waited three and a half hours and got half a page", he recalled. "We drank, watched TV and played cards, waiting. But I was so proud. I proved the Internet existed".[21] At a conference in 2010, Ma revealed that he has never actually written a line of code nor made one sale to a customer. He acquired a computer for the first time at the age of 33.[22]From 1998 to 1999, Ma headed an information technology company established by the China International Electronic Commerce Center, a department of the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation. In 1999, he quit and returned to Hangzhou with his team to found Alibaba, a China-based business-to-business marketplace site in his apartment with a group of 18 friends.[23] He started a new round of venture development with 500,000 yuan.Business career
